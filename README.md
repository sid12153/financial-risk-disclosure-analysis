# Financial Risk & Disclosure Analysis Using Public Filings
Analysts and consultants often need to read long financial filings to understand a company’s risks, regulatory exposure, and forward-looking concerns. These documents are dense, repetitive, and time-consuming to analyze, especially when comparing disclosures across reporting periods or companies.

This project explores how public financial filings such as SEC 10-K and 10-Q reports can be processed and queried in a structured way to support risk and disclosure analysis. The system retrieves relevant sections from source documents based on analyst-style questions and produces concise summaries that are explicitly grounded in the underlying text.

A key focus of this project is reliability rather than generation. The system is designed to surface evidence from filings, cite the source of each response, and avoid answering questions when the available documents do not provide sufficient information.
